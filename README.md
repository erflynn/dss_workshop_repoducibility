# Data Science Workshop: Practical Tools to Fight the Reproducibility Crisis 

We know the reproducibility crisis is a huge issue, even in data science. One aspect of this problem relates to better coding practices.

One would think that in computational sciences can avoid these problems because code, by its very nature, can be re-run. However, in practice, research code is often very messy, poorly documented, and set up to only work in a particular environment. Messy code is also more error-prone and harder to update and debug. 

In this workshop, we'll talk about how to take messy research code and make it easily available and re-runnable, as well as free of common errors. This way, not only will your work be easier for others to redo, but also you'll be your own best collaborator for when you need to update your work, find problems, or come back to your work after a long break.

List of lessons:
1. Set up a git repository for the code and make sure that it runs. Get started [here](setting_up_your_code.md). 
2. Work on [making code modular](modular_code.Rmd).
3. Write unit tests.
4. Debug confusing error messages...
