# Lesson 0: Make the code available!

You want to reproduce the figures from [Grady et al](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/eaat4220). Your co-worker says their friend Bob has started on this, so you reach out to their friend via email. Bob responds, excited you're working on this project, and sends you this [file](bob_grady_code_final_v2.R) via email.

You're eager to get going and happy you don't have to start from scratch, so you open the file...

It's hard to tell what's going on. You try to run the file with R but you start getting all of these errors about files not being found and dependencies. You realize you're going to have to edit Bob's code just to start. You start to rename the file "bob_grady_code_final_v2.R" to "bob_grady_code_final_v2_my_version.R", but there's a better way.

## Introduction to version control 

#### Background: why version control, what is it?

#### Activity: Set up a git repository on GitHub
#### Activity: Put the code in it, commit

## Getting the code to run? File paths and package dependencies

#### Background: Relative paths
#### Activity: Fix the paths
#### Background: Package dependencies + versions
#### Activity: Install the needed packages and document this
